GeekSwimmers is a web application designed to assist curious swimmers, who love to dig into data points, to figure out what they are missing to reach their goals. We started with time standards, but everything that can help swimmers to fine tune their performance is welcome. We're excited to see it growing organically, implementing what swimmers are curious about as opposed to what we think they need.
