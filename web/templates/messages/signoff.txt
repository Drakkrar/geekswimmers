We are sorry to see you go :-(

7 days from now we will:

 - discard your email address, first name, last name, and password
 - keep your username to prevent other people from using it

Your data will be kept for 7 days. If you decide to return within this period, a simple sign in will reactivate your account, otherwise your data will be permanently removed. You can always create another account with the same email later, however your username will have to change.

Please, reply to this email if you need further clarifications.

It was a pleasure serving you!
